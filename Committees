This course uses the novel idea of forming committees within the students to help each other and to improve communication, collaboration, team work, leadership among others. 

I will be overheading all the committees :) :) and any major decision will be overseen by me :)

Committees :

Generic Guidelines
●	The committee members should create a friendly atmosphere for other students to interact and learn from them. 
●	They should be open and encourage discussion among different teams and so on.
●	They should create curiosity and drive the course activities more rigorously
●	There is a chair for every committee. It does not mean that chair has extra qualifications but rather is the primary contact (aka responsible).
